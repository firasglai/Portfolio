title: "About me"
---

After graduating with a **computer systems and software degree**, I decided to pursue my passion for programming. I enrolled in software engineering studies while pursuing to learn **full-stack web development**.

My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is **Angular, SpringBoot, Node.js, MySQL and MongoDB**. I am also familiar with TypeScript with React and NextJS. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer.

When I'm not coding I enjoy playing video games, camping, and traveling. I also enjoy learning new things. I am currently learning how to play chess.
