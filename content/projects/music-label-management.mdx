# Music Label Production Management System

A comprehensive frontend application for managing music label operations, featuring artist management, revenue tracking, and distribution analytics built with modern React technologies.

## Project Overview

As a frontend developer on this project, I contributed to building a sophisticated management platform for a music label production company. The system enables efficient management of artists, tracks revenue streams, and provides insights into distribution performance.

## Key Features

The platform offers comprehensive artist onboarding capabilities, real-time performance analytics, and integrated distribution channel management, enabling music labels to efficiently manage their operations and make data-driven decisions.

## Technical Implementation

Built with React and styled using SCSS, the application utilizes Chart.js for data visualization, Zustand for state management, and React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
