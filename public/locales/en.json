I started with basic coding, but quickly wanted to learn it all, so I set out to master full-stack development. Why choose one specialty when learning more is just so much fun?",
        "par2":"Solving problems is honestly my favorite thing; there's something great about finally fixing a tough bug or making something work just right. I'm always curious and love trying out new technologies—even if it means chasing the latest trends like my code chases missing commas.",
        "par3":"When I'm not diving in code, you'll find me diving in a swim, camping, or traveling—usually looking for good Wi-Fi and a bit of adventure. My goal is to become a multispecialist—kind of like a Swiss Army knife, but for software.",
        "par4":"Right now, I'm looking for a full-time developer role where I can bring plenty of code, creativity, and a sense of humor to the team."
